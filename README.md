I have finished a complete pass over the fundamental concepts in the book *Functional Programming Made Easier* by Charles Scalfani. [Link to buy here](https://leanpub.com/fp-made-easier).

In my opinion, it is a very good <u><em>engineering book for engineers</em></u>. I did notice a few patterns that the author did out of (good) habit as an experienced engineer. These patterns added some noise to my learning process. That being said, I deeply appreciate the amount of work and dedication put forth by Charles to make the book possible. Truly a labor of love.

In this first complete pass, I covered the most fundamental concepts of funtional programming, and most importantly finally developed an intuition for this paradigm:

- [x] the syntax and semantics
- [x] the data abstraction philosophy:
    - ADTs
    - separation of data and functions
- [x] the math that supports this philosophy:
    - Church-Turing calculus (a taste of it)
    - Category Theory (a taste of it, up to monads)
    - the language-specific implementation of these ideas in PureScript (Haskell-family)

I also did personal research outside of the book for many of the above bullet points. In total, I spent the first 8 months taking notes on and off in my spare time, covering the first half of the book including algebraic structures. In the most recent 3 months, I made push to cover the scond half that discusses advanced concepts like monads and transformers, and to get a taste of the libraries.

The *complete* pass indeed put many things into perspective. I plan to come back and do another pass to bolster the parts that I skimmed or missed, and prepare the ground for [Lens and Optics](https://thomashoneyman.com/articles/practical-profunctor-lenses-optics/#wrapping-up).
