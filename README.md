I have just finished a incomplete pass over the fundamentals of the book [Functional Programming Made Easier](https://leanpub.com/fp-made-easier) by Charles Scalfani. In my opinion, it is a very good <u><em>engineering book, written by an engineer for engineers</em></u>. It is most useful book on the topic of functional programming I have read about. I have tried a few books, and this book just clicked like no others. 

It is a tome of references that you will definitely go back to many times. If you choose to go through it chapter by chapter (as the author intended) you will gain a *very solid* foundation in functional programming.

Once I got far enough into the book, I started noticing a few patterns that the author keeps repeating. These are actually valuable habits to pick up for beginners, because they are condensed probably from years of real-world experience. However, they indeed added some noise to my learning process. This is not a problem with the book, but rather to show how dense with information the book is. It contains both theoretical and practical information.

In this first pass, I covered the foundational concepts and developed an intuition for functional programming as a paradigm:

- [x] the syntax and semantics
- [x] the data abstraction philosophy
    - ADTs
    - separation of data and functions
- [x] the math that supports this philosophy
    - Church-Turing calculus
    - Category Theory

It took me about 12 months for this pass. I spent the first 8 months on the first half of the book, jumping and skipping and recurring liberally through out the chapters. I took heavy notes through out these 8 months. My focus was internalizing the syntax and core concepts. I also needed to soak up on the theory (algebraic structures and some category theory). I then spent the next 3 months to cover the second half of the book. This part is where I got to the fun stuff like monads and transformers. I also got a taste of some practical libraries for web development (both client-side and server-side).

Unfortunately, when I read the book (2023), a couple libraries had been deprecated. This is not a big problem, because now I can read and understand Haskell much more readily, which has almost identical syntax but with a much larger community of tools and libraries.

It was a lot of time and effort, but it has been totally worth it. Is this what it feels like to be a demi-god? It's like the scales have fallen off my eyes, and the world of programming has suddenly become so much more vibrant and full of possibilities.

This pass has indeed put many things into perspective. I plan to come back and do another pass to bolster the parts that I skimmed or missed. Also to prepare the ground for [Lens and Optics](https://thomashoneyman.com/articles/practical-profunctor-lenses-optics/#wrapping-up).
